title: "Hello There"

I'm Stephan Tarulli, and I've been designing and building large-scale distributed systems for a decade.
I like to occasionally write down thoughts I'm having and I do that here.

If you like open-ended writing and sometimes learning a thing or two, you may be able to find something intriguing to read here.
I make no promises.
