I've felt that I need to get better at writing for awhile, but I wasn't sure how to begin the improvement process.
So I did what I always do and turned to DuckDuckGo in the hopes of unearthing advice.
In hindsight, this was a bad idea because everyone has opinions on what resources are the best and the popular answers are dependent on genre.

Among the large amount of advice a few books continuously popped up, so I figured why not buy them and see what they're about.
Those books are "The Elements of Style" by Strunk & White and  "On Writing Well" by Zinsser.[^1]

My hope is that I can learn enough from them to improve the precision of my writing, both for myself and my daily work.
The majority of my day-to-day job involves communicating with others and I would like to be more effective.
I expect that as I continue my career my job will continually become more communication focused, so hopefully this is an investment that will compound.

[^1]: I'm betting anyone with an English major probably could have guessed these.
